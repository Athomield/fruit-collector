# fruit-collector
This is a regular Unity Project so just navigate with Unity Hub and open it with the 2020.3.18f version.
There are 2 Scenes Menus (for the menus) and Main (for the mini game itself)
Please when testing the mini-game lauch directly from the Main scene instead of using the Menus scene to go to the mini-game (because of wired lighting behaviour)

I would say the most of the milestones I have set for the past 2 days have been achieved although not polished (especially for the UI which I didn't get the time to animate)

I tried to go for a more happy theme with the choice of color. If I had more time I would have tried to incorporate snappy animations into the gameplay (and ofcourse the UI). I went for a simple game idea : collec the fruit and put them into the basket, when you get the fruit; go back the same way you came from. Its a good idea for starters, could have improved upon iterative improvements and polishing.
